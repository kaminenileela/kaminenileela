## Highlights
- Implemented a 3 - tier application "expense" that tracks the expenses of the users through shell scripting manually.
- Implemented GITOPS where the GIT is the source code repository (single source of truth, for all the applications related code)
- Implemented project infrastructure through Terraform i.e., setting up VPC, security groups, VPN, RDS database, application load balancer.
- Implemented continuous integration through Jenkins pipelines wherein the upstream job integrates the 'expense' project artifacts into nexus
  and the downstream job is triggered which leads to the application infra creation (backend and frontend servers) through terraform and the servers configuration is done through ansible roles and shell scripting.
- Implemented DevSecOps where the artifact is scanned (for security issues) before integrating it to nexus repository, prior to DEV stage.
- Monitoring is also done through ELK suite where ELastic search is used to store logs, Logstash is used to filter logs and Kibana is used to visualise the metrics.
- Docker is used for building the application related images adhering docker best practices.
- Kubernetes is used for container orchestration of this application through EKS cluster and Horizontal pod auto scaling.
